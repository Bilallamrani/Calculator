## Docker


To setup this development environment you will need to have *docker* and
*docker-compose* installed on you system. You can add your projects to the
folder _htdocs_ and a _file.sql_ into the folder _data_.

To run the environment:


The environment is composed of *PHP*, *Apache* (running on port _80_), *MariaDB*
and *PHPmyadmin* (running on port _8081_).

This environment is a basic one with only an handful of tools. If you need to
implement new things, such as a mailing system, you will have to do so on the
_docker-compose.yml_ or/and _Dockerfile_.

If all is well you should have access to your environment at
http://localhost:80.
